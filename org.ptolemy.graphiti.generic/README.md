# org.ptolemy.graphiti.generic

This plugin implements a generic graphical editor for actor networks, based on the graphiti framework. The editor may sit on top of different underlying actor network models and Xtext-based DSLs, the logic of which are exposed through facade classes used for navigating and editing the model.

The editor uses Google's dependency injection framework Guice for customization.
